# Daily Lessons

This directory contains all 50 days of the deep learning course.

## 🎯 The Commitment

**The course will finish on December 31st, 2025. Let's finish this year's resolution—together.**

Plan your schedule: Spend 1-2 hours daily, and you'll complete all 50 days by the deadline.

## Structure

Each day folder follows this structure:

```
day XX/
├── README.md              # Day overview and objectives
├── notebooks/             # Jupyter notebooks
│   └── day_XX_exercise.ipynb
├── code/                  # Python scripts (optional)
├── data/                  # Day-specific datasets (optional)
└── outputs/               # Generated plots/results
```

## Navigation

- **Day 1:** [What is Deep Learning?](day%201/)
- **Day 2:** [The Perceptron Explained](day%202/)
- **Day 3:** [Introduction to Neural Networks](day%203/)
- ... (see main README.md for full list)

## Tips: Finish by December 31st, 2025

- **Work through days sequentially** - Don't skip ahead; each day builds on the previous
- **Complete all exercises** - Practice is essential for understanding
- **Take notes** - Write summaries in the day's README or notebook
- **Track your progress** - Mark off completed days in the main README
- **Stay consistent** - Better to spend 1 hour daily than 7 hours once a week
- **Don't rush** - Understanding is key, but keep the December 31st deadline in mind
- **Share progress** - Use #50DaysDeepLearning for accountability
