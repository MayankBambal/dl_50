- **Books:**
  - "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow - Chapter 1 (Introduction)

**Level 3 (Data Scientist):**
- **Video:**
  - Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization - Course 1, Week 1

## **Plan**

**Objectives:**
- Understand the relationship between AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
- Recognize real-world applications of deep learning
- Set up Python environment and install PyTorch
- Understand the basic structure of a neural network conceptually

**Deep Learning Concept(s):**
- Artificial Intelligence hierarchy (AI → ML → DL)
- Supervised vs. Unsupervised vs. Reinforcement Learning
- Deep Learning definition and characteristics
- Introduction to neural networks as universal function approximators

**Tools Used:**
- Google Colab (primary environment for all course work)
- Python 3.12+ (pre-installed in Colab)
- NumPy (for basic array operations)
- PyTorch installation and verification (pre-installed in Colab)
- Jupyter Notebooks (via Google Colab)
- Functions: `torch.__version__`, `numpy.array()`, `import torch`

**Key Learnings:**
- How to verify PyTorch installation: `torch.cuda.is_available()` for GPU support
- Basic tensor concept (though not yet implemented)
- Setting up Google Colab and enabling GPU runtime
- Understanding the difference between deep learning frameworks
- Using Google Colab's free GPU resources for deep learning
